Quick Sort:-


(1) Select middle  element as pivot element from array.

(2) Now we have to find a plase for pivot element 
    so the all smaller element are left side of pivot and 
    larger values are right side of pivot element in array.

(3) For that create a loop which is starting from start which find elements which are larger than pivot.

(4) create another loop which starting from end of the array and find elements which are smaller than pivot.

(5) Now Increment first loop until you find an element with is greater than pivot.

(6) Now Decrement second loop until you find an element which is smaller than picot.

(7) Swap the place of this element.

(8) if first loop and second loop cross then swap the place of second element as pivot.

(9) That is the plase of pivot element.

(10) Now repate a all staps for left side of pivot element.

(11) same goes for right side of pivot element.
