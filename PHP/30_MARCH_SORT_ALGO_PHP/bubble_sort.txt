Bubble Sort:-https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lZKcdomXa45l1rRweS3RIRG6qV0dH9CU/view?usp=sharing


(1) In Bubble Sort we have to compare pairs of elements.

(2) If the second value is smaller  then first value then we have to swap that value.

(3) It continues for all elements in array.

(4) At the end of the first loop we have one sorted element at end of the loop.

(5) It continues till there is no swap required.
